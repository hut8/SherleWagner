TEST<br />
THE EMBODIMENT OF LUXURY— <br/>
UNAPOLOGETIC, UNABASHED, UNCOMPROMISING LUXURY. <br/>
WE ARE THE ROMANCERS OF THE LAVISH. <br/>
THE LOVERS OF THE EXQUISITE. <br/>
THE COURTERS OF THE CONTEMPORARY. <br/>
METICULOUS WITH DETAILS, RELENTLESS WITH QUALITY, <br/>
WE ARE THE NEMESIS OF THE ORDINARY. <br/>
ENABLERS OF THE ELEGANT. <br/>
MOLDERS OF THE MODERN. <br/>
DISCIPLES OF THE PRECISE. <br/>
WE ARE THE GUARDIANS OF OLD-WORLD MASTERY. <br/>
KEEPERS OF VALUES THAT ARE SET IN STONE— <br/>
IN ONYX, IN JASPER, IN AMETHYST. <br/>
A TIGHT-KNIT FAMILY OF PATHOLOGICAL PERFECTIONISTS <br/>
ALL SHARING THE SAME OBSESSION FOR EXCELLENCE, <br/>
PASSING IT DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION— <br/>
CRAFTSMAN TO CRAFTSMAN, <br/>
ARTISAN TO ARTISAN, DREAMER TO DREAMER. <br/>
ANCHORED BY OUR HISTORY, <br/>
PROPELLED INTO THE FUTURE BY OUR HERITAGE, <br/>
WE ARE HERE TO SHOWER BRILLIANCE UPON THE WORLD, <br/>
TURN ON THE FAUCETS OF IMAGINATION, <br/>
WASH AWAY CONFORMISM. <br/>
WE ARE HERE TO HELP VISIONS TAKE SHAPE, TAKE FLIGHT, <br/>
SAIL THE SEAS OF THE SUBLIME. <br/>
WE ARE PURE AMERICAN SPLENDOR. WE ARE <br/>
